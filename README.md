Talos cluster on Proxmox
========================

This repository contains a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration to create a [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/) Kubernetes cluster on servers running [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/).
It includes a basic Kubernetes configuration to run services on the cluster, which includes [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) as CNI, [Talos CCM](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos-cloud-controller-manager) and [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) to deploy services in a GitOps way.
  

## Requirements

- Proxmox server(s)
- terraform
- kubectl
- go
- nmap


## Usage

- Make sure all tools are installed and are set in your PATH;
- Run `task init` to initialize the Terraform providers;
- Download the correct Talos release image and place it in a folder which Proxmox can access;
- Change the `mac-to-ip_scan_subnets` variable to match to subnets on which Proxmox creates the VMs by default;
- Optionally run `terraform plan` to see what will be created;
- Run `task create` to create the VMs, boot the Talos cluster and run some basic Kubernetes services.


## How it works

- Terraform creates VMs in Proxmox using a Talos release image;
- Terraform creates Talos configs and applies it to the VMs running Talos;
- A Talos control plane is bootstrapped and a Talos cluster is formed;
- Terraform generates the inline manifests (containing Cilium and Talos CCM) which Talos installs;
- Terraform waits for the nodes to be ready and installs Argo CD;
- Argo CD installs all specified services and applications;
- Argo CD keeps the services and applications in sync with the [manifests](manifests/) in this repository.

If everything works as expected, Argo CD should automatically install metrics-server on the recently created Kubernetes cluster.
